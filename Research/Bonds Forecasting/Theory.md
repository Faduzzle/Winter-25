### Modeling Bond prices

So we know returns on bonds are $$ R = \frac{C}{P_t}+\frac{P_{t+1} +-P_t}{P_t}$$
where
$$C=\text{Coupon payments}$$
$$P_t = \text{Price at time }t$$
$$P_{t+1} = \text{Price at time } t+1$$

It can also be viewed as
$$\text{current yield = } \frac{C}{P_t}$$
and
$$\text{capital gains = }\frac{P_{t+1} +-P_t}{P_t}$$

Bond price changes due to interest rate due to 
$$\text{Price = }\frac{C}{YTM}$$
where $YTM$ is analogous to interest rate

## Demand and Supply for Bonds

### Some factors that affect the demand for bonds are
1. Wealth
    - savings of consumers
1. Expected returns on bonds relative to alternative assets
    - YTM rate
1. liquidity of bonds to alternative assets

If any of these "increase" the demands of bonds increase
- drives the bond price down
    - Increases YTM

#### Risk of bonds due to alternative assets 
increased risk will drive prices up since it lowers demand

### Shifts in Bond Supply
1. Expected profitability in investment opportunities
    - when firms have lots of profitable opportunities and the business cycle is expanding.
    
    Then supply of bonds increases $\implies$ bond prices increase
1. expected inflation
    - increase in expected inflation $\implies$ the supply of bonds to increase $\implies$ bond prices to increase

1. government budget deficits
    - increases government deficits $\implies$ increased bond supply $\implies$ increased bond prices

#### Important observation!!!
When expected inflation rises $\implies$ interest rates rise!

Can tie this back to bond prices falling.

## Can also view similar results in money supply/demand

Money demand
- increased demand $\implies$ increased interest rate
    - demand drivers :

Money supply
- increased supply $\implies$ increased interest rate
    - supply drivers :

#### Theoretically, when there are increases in money supply the interest rate will slowly **increase** to the equilibrium interest rate

## What happens when trump cuts tax rates?
Demand for tax friendly municpal bonds decrease (value is lowered)

        Prices decrease and their associated YTM or interest rate increases

Demand for Treasury bonds INCREASE 

        Prices INCREASE and their associated YTM or interest rate DECREASES

## Can do similar analysis for expected inflation :P

## Some interesting theory
- Bonds of different maturity are NOT perfect subtitutes

     so the interest rate of longer maturity bonds are NOT the expected average interest rates of short term bonds

- Then the interest rate for a specific maturity is determined by the supply and demand of that bond

    - think of demands of long term vs short term investors
    - extrapolate investor behavior in business cycle
    - what drives these preferences?

    *interesting thought*: birthrates are declining. Means less people are saving for their children $\implies$ declining demand for longer maturities

### Applied Theory

    Demand sources 
        Savings rate, trading volume, AEIE, gdp/capita
        1,2,5,10,30yr bonds rate - stock volatility/returns
        expected inflation
        risk/alternative assets

    Supply sources
        Business cycle data, public debt growth rate?, E[TFP growth]?,  bond supply volume
        expected inflation
        budget deficit data - can try to forcast this too!

for savings rate, there is a steady state we can try to figure out where the economy is moving to.
