## Notes on Quant Finance
Here I want to write down some things I've come across my research on quant. finance

### Look up
- Merton's ICAPM
- iid, or $N(\mu,\sigma)$
    - this assumption makes modeling super easy
    - fat tails, mixture modeling, serial correlation
- Value at Risk, Credit Risk, liquidity risk
    - links:
        - [Ny times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html?_r=1&dlbk=&pagewanted=all)
- risk management
- copulas?
- 'perfect' delta hedging
- dangers of backtesting
    - slippage
- corporate actions
    - e.g. M&A, changes in leverage(selling bonds), takeovers, spinouts

- [interesting paper on value investing](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2329262)
- uncertainty analysis






### Overall Emperical testing
- correlation
    - correlations usually are the backbone of a strategy or capital market assumptions but they tend to fail during market crashes

- CAPM
    - capm is useful only to evaluate $\alpha$ and $\beta$
    - ex: if you're looking for market neutral strategy, the $\beta$ should not be too high

- Value at Risk, Credit Risk, liquidity risk
    - other risk management tools

- backtesting
    - becareful, lots of pitfalls
